description: Repositories that store user data

User Data Repositories, or Repositories for short, is the name for the data storage system used by the Atmosphere.

Each user has their own Repository that stores all of their data, including their profile information, posts, and other content.

Repositories are owned by [Personal Data Servers](../pds/index.mdx), which are responsible for storing and serving the data in the Repositories.

Repositories are organized into [Collections](./collection.mdx) where each Collection is identified by a unique URI.
The URI can be used to resolve the [Lexicon](../lexicon/index.mdx) definition of the Collection, which describes the structure of the Records in the Collection.
