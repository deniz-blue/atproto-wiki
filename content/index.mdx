The AT Protocol is a decentralized data protocol that enables applications to interact with the Atmosphere, a global network of interconnected data and services.

In the AT Protocol, users actually own their data and can choose which applications have access to it.
This allows for a more open and interoperable ecosystem, where users can easily switch between applications without losing their data.
