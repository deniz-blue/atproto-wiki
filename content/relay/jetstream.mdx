Jetstream is a filtered real-time stream of events in the Atmosphere.
It allows applications to subscribe to changes in specific [collections](../repo/collection.mdx) and/or [DIDs](../identity/did.mdx),
providing a more targeted and efficient way to monitor updates compared to the [Firehose](firehose.mdx).
