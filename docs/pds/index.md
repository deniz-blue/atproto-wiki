# Personal Data Servers

Personal Data Servers, or PDSes, are servers that store [User Data Repositories](../repo/index.md).

Every User Repository is owned by a PDS, and every PDS can have multiple User Repositories. Users can choose which PDS they want to use, and can even run their own PDS if they want.
